# Document Search Engine Web Application
 This is a web application to search for the documents based on the matching words. The application is capable of searching the documents from various sources like web libraries, web links, local folder and remote folder. The goal is to provide a very quick assistance to the people with best possible documents based on their needs in no time.

A very important part of this project was a working and interesting interface. Although I have tried my best to create the web application as interesting as possible, but I will appreciate if someone can make more modification to the program and make it even better.
